## Known Bugs
While playing the game through Editor, sometimes the frames saved on CharacterSOsâ€™ on some animations are removed and have to click Build again on the CharacterSO.

On the 2DPlatformer template, the token animations are sped up randomly but will return normal after some time. Only happens on WebGL and not in Editor.

Known bugs seem to mainly relate to the Unity Engine itself and WebGL. Inconsistent when trying to replicate bugs. Possibility fixed on a newer version of Unity.
